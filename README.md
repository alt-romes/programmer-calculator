## Programmer calculator

The programmer calculator is a simple terminal tool designed to give maximum efficiency and flexibility to the programmer working with: 

* binary, hexadecimal and decimal representations at the same time
* bitwise operations
* various operand sizes *(16bits, 32bits, 8bits, etc)*

and who likes:

* a clear, simple and customizable interface
* open source software
* terminal/cli tools

The above picture depicts `pcalc` without colors, and below is an example of `pcalc` with colors enabled (`--colors`) (which change depending on the terminal profile colors)

## Making of

The idea was born while developing a Nintendo Gameboy Emulator. Romes - the pitcher - found that the tools given online were clunky and did not allow for "nice multitasking"

With the constant need to visualize and manipulate bits, it became evident that a better solution had to come to life

## Installation

#### Homebrew

Install from the homebrew official packages
```
brew install pcalc
```

#### Arch Based Distros

Install from AUR
```
yay -S programmer-calculator
```

#### Building from Source (alternative)

##### Prerequisites:
To build from source you need `gcc`, `ncurses`, and the source files. 
**If you don't have ncurses, please install it (i.e. with your system's package manager) first.**
*(To install ncurses in Debian based distros run `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`)*

##### Building:

First, clone the repository and change directory to it
```
git clone https://github.com/alt-romes/programmer-calculator ; cd programmer-calculator
```

Then, compile the code into an executable file and install it (installs in /usr/local/bin)
```
sudo make install
```

Conversely, if you ever want to uninstall, you can run:
```
sudo make uninstall
```

#### Updating
Either re-build from source, or, using brew do
```
brew update
```
followed by
```
brew upgrade pcalc
```

#### Running

Just run the programmer calculator program
```
pcalc
```

## Features

### Usage

There are various ways to insert values/operators, see the example `2 + 2` below:

* `2`, followed by `+`, followed by `2`
* `2`, followed by `+2`
* `2+`, followed by `2`
* `2+2` (or i.e. `2 + 2`)

#### Inline Math

Operator precedence and parenthesis for grouping is used.

`2+2*3` evaluates to `8` and `(2+2)*3` evaluates to `12`


### Hex + Binary + Decimal

All three number representations are available at the same time, you can insert `0xff + 0b101101 - 5` directly onto the calculator


### Operand Size

By default, 64 bits are used for arithmetic, however, when working with bits, quite often we want to work with less. With this calculator you can change the amount of bits used. the number displayed will be unsigned

To use 16 bits instead, type `16bit` (bits will also work)

To use 8 bits, type `8bit`

To use 0 < n <= 64 bits, type `nbit`


### Customizing Interface

While running the calculator, you can type *what you see* for it to appear/disappear:

`history` to toggle the history
`decimal` to toggle the decimal representation
`binary` to toggle the binary representation
`hex` to toggle the hexadecimal representation
`operation` to toggle the operation display

Additionally, the interface colors can be toggled on and off.

To set a default interface, define an alias for the program with the desired hidden options
```
alias pcalc='pcalc -ibxdosn'
```
i: history, b: binary, x: hex, d: decimal, o: operation, s: symbols, n: no colors

You can also use the long options to hide parts: `--history`, `--decimal`, etc.


### Operations
```
ADD  +    SUB  -    MUL  *    DIV  /
MOD  %    AND  &    OR   |    NOR  $
XOR  ^    NOT  ~    SL   <    SR   >
RL   :    RR   ;    2's  _    SE   @
```

* ADD: `a + b` arithmetic addition
* SUB: `a - b` arithmetic subtraction
* MUL: `a * b` arithmetic multiplication
* DIV: `a / b` arithmetic integer division
* MOD: `a % b` modulus from the division
* AND: `a & b` bit-wise AND operation
* OR : `a | b` bit-wise OR operation
* NOR: `a $ b` bit-wise NOR operation : opposite of OR
* XOR: `a ^ b` bit-wise XOR operation : exclusive OR
* NOT: `~a`    bit-wise NOT operation : change all bits of a, 0's into 1's and 1's into 0's
* SL : `a < b` bit-wise SHIFT-LEFT operation : shift a left b number of times
* SR : `a > b` bit-wise SHIFT-RIGHT operation : shift a right b number of times
* RL : `a : b` bit-wise ROTATE-LEFT operation : rotate a left b number of times
* RR : `a ; b` bit-wise ROTATE-RIGHT operation : rotate a right b number of times
* 2's: `_a`    2's complement operation : 2's complement of a (usually is the symmetric of a)
* SE : `@a`    swap endianness : swap the byte order of a (uses the number of bits set by `bit` to determine the amount of bits swapped)
